# /plan - Implementation Planning

Plan a feature or task with clear structure before coding.

## When to Use

- `C2` direct changes where you want a lightweight implementation plan.
- `C2` changes where you want a more structured planning workflow via Superpowers `writing-plans`.
- Any time the scope is still fuzzy and you want to clarify goal/DoD.

## When NOT to Use

- If classification is `C3` or `C4`, use a governed workflow:
  - `C3` (Standard Governed): open change -> scan -> implement step-by-step -> validate -> archive.
  - `C4` (Discovery-First): open change -> **mandatory exploration phase** (map codebase, enumerate unknowns, write discovery summary) -> **user approval on scope** -> implement -> validate -> archive. Do not begin implementation until exploration is complete and user approves.

Always run `/route` first if category is not already explicit.

## Framework: Goal → Constraints → Definition of Done

### Step 1: Clarify Goal

Ask for or derive:

- **What**: One-sentence description of the desired outcome
- **Why**: Business/technical motivation
- **Who**: Who benefits from this change

### Step 2: Identify Constraints

Consider:

- Existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Dependencies and compatibility requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security implications
- Testing requirements
- Rollback expectations

### Step 3: Define Success Criteria (DoD)

Create measurable acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Tests pass (existing + new)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Rollback path is clear

### Step 4: Break Down Tasks

Create a task list with:

1. Research/exploration phase (if needed)
2. Implementation steps (ordered by dependency)
3. Testing steps
4. Cleanup/documentation

### Step 5: Identify Risks

List potential blockers:

- Unknown areas requiring investigation
- External dependencies
- Breaking changes

### Step 6: Decide First Command

Pick the next command to run:

- `/context` when you need entrypoints, dependencies, or conventions
- `/review` when the change touches auth/permissions/tokens/secrets
- `/test` when doing TDD or validating an assumption
- `superpowers:writing-plans` when you need a structured, detailed execution plan
- `superpowers:brainstorming` when you need option exploration before committing to one plan
